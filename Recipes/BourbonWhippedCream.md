# Boubon Whipped Cream
Goes great on Peppered Pumpkin Pie!

## Ingredients

    * 1 cup of whipping cream
    * 1 tablespoon of bourbon
    * 0-3 tablespoons of confectioners sugar (or 2 teaspoons of honey)

## Directions

    * Thouroughly chill whipping cream and bourbon
    * Combine whipping cream, bourbon, and confectioners sugar (or honey)
    * Whip together until stiff-ish peaks form. (If it is hot, you may wish to whip over ice, placing ice in a large bowl and the whipping cream in a smaller metal or glass bowl resting in the ice.)
